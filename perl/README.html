<p>
This subdirectory contains the nexml parser code for Bio::Phylo.
Much of this code has been written by Jason Caravas during his
Google Summer of Code project, and subsequently tweaked by 
Rutger Vos. To build this, you will need the Bio::Phylo release
from CPAN (which has two optional prerequisites: SVG.pm for tree
drawing and Math::Random for simulations) and XML::Twig (which
requires XML::Parser, which is built on top of expat).
</p>
<p>
The code in this subdirectory is released under the standard
perl licensing scheme, which is a dual system supplying users
a choice between the artistic license and the GNU public license.
</p>
<p>
Provided you have the prerequisites, you can build this code
by issuing:<br/>
<code>$ perl Makefile.PL</code><br/>
<code>$ make</code><br/>
Which places the built code in a 'blib' subdirectory of this
folder.
</p>
<p>To run the test suite (which will fail at this stage of the development), issue:<br/>
<code>$ make test</code><br/>
To install (but don't do that just yet, instead point your $PERL5LIB
to the lib/ folder), issue:<br/>
<code>$ make install</code><br/>
</p>
