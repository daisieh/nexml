Java validation code (in java/validator subdirectory) relies on the Apache 
Xerces jars.  See java/validator/jars/LICENSE for the licensing information for
that code.  (That validation code is useful to developers, but does not have to
be distributed end-users, so that licensing information does not have to be 
bundled with end-user distributions)
