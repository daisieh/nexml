<p>
This subdirectory contains java classes for nexml parsing,
a mesquite extension that uses these classes (for mesquite's
"import" facility) and a Xerces-J based validator. The validator
is based on code written by Terri Liebowitz of the San Diego
Supercomputing Center, and modified by Mark Holder. The parser
classes and mesquite bindings were written by Rutger Vos.
