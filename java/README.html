<p>
	The <a href="https://github.com/nexml/nexml.java">NeXML java library on github</a> is
	intended to be a reference implementation of the standard using only core Java API
	classes. The library is currently used by the (optional) Mesquite NeXML I/O extension
	(also part of the same source tree on github) as well as TreeBASE's NeXML 
	serialization.
