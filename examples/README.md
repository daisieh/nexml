NeXML example files
===================

This subdirectory contains nexml documents. These example files are non-normative, they
are just meant to illustrate some of the facilities of the nexml specification. At present,
they reference the schema by a relative path: ../xsd/nexml.xsd. To validate them, you
therefore need to have the schema itself too. The way we have it set up is to clone out
the full project from [the github repository](http://github.com/nexml/nexml),
and then open the files in a schema aware xml editor. We use the 
[oXygen](http://www.oxygenxml.com/) xml plugin for 
[eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) to edit xml, but there are of course many others.
